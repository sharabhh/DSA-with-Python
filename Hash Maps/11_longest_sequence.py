# Given an unsorted array of integers, write a function that finds the length of the  longest_consecutive_sequence (i.e., sequence of integers in which each element is one greater than the previous element).
# Use sets to optimize the runtime of your solution.
# Input: An unsorted array of integers, nums.
# Output: An integer representing the length of the longest consecutive sequence in nums.
